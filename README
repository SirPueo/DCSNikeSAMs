# Nike Hercules Mod

This is a rough pass at a Nike Hercules mod. I do not intend to continue development any further as this was just an exercise in exploring the DCS modding environment.

Missing features:
- Unit dependencies (most units can operate independently, not requiring support equipment)
- Nuclear warhead (currently using a rough approximation of the conventional warhead)
- Refined missile performance (missile may be overperforming, likely having too little drag)
- Detailed Textures (very basic textures currently present)
