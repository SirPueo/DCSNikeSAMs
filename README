This is a rough pass at a Nike Hercules mod.

Missing features:
- Nuclear warhead (currently using a rough approximation of the conventional warhead)
- Refined missile performance (missile may be overperforming, likely having too little drag)
- Detailed Textures (very basic textures currently present)
- Animated Launcher (currently a static object with missile in upright position as if on alert)
